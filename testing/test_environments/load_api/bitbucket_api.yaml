      # Bitbucket Cloud OAuth 2.0 


      Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in

      such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become

      valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your

      existing consumer and configure a callback URL.


      Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

      For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support all 4 of RFC-6749's grant

      flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access tokens:



      ### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)


      The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by

      sending their browser to:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

      The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap

      for an access token:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


      ### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)


      This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without server-side backends.


      Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

      That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment

      containing the access token

      (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can

      pull it out of the URL.



      ### 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3)


      Useful if you have the end user's password but you want to use a more

      secure end user access token instead. This method will not work when the user has two-step verification enabled.

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=password \
            -d username={username} -d password={password}


      ### 4. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)


      Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access

      token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the

      client/consumer:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=client_credentials


      ### 5. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)


      If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a

      JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the

      account for which the add-on is installed.


      Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header

      using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme

      makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl

      -u").

          $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


      ## Making Requests 


      Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a request in any of

      the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):


      1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

      2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as `access_token={access_token}`

      3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST: `?access_token={access_token}`



      ## Repository Cloning 


      Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone

      with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to

      clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly

      different:

          $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

      The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is

      required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in

      the username field).



      ## Refresh Tokens 


      Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401

      responses.


      Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded). Therefore, you should include a

      refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,

      without the need for end user participation:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


      # Scopes for the Bitbucket Cloud REST API 


      Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary scopes.


      Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each string being the name of a unique scope.


      A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users authorizing/installing the add-on

      to explicitly accept all scopes.


      Our best practice suggests you add the scopes your add-on needs, but no more than it needs.


      Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the installation to fail.


      Following is the set of all currently available scopes.


      ### repository


      Gives the add-on read access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to.

      Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull requests.


      * access to the repo's source code

      * clone over https

      * access the the file browsing API

      * download zip archives of the repo's contents

      * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment, vote, etc)

      * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)


      ### repository:write


      Gives the add-on write (not admin) access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope implies `repository`, which does not need to be requested separately.

      This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.


      * push access over https

      * fork repos


      ### repository:admin


      Gives the add-on admin access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope does not imply `repository` or `repository:write`. It gives access to the admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. Of course it can be (mis)used to grant read access to another user account who can then clone the repo, but repos that need to read of write source code would also request explicit read or write.

      This scope comes with access to the following functionality:


      * view and manipulate committer mappings

      * list and edit deploy keys

      * ability to delete the repo

      * view and edit repo permissions

      * view and edit branch permissions

      * import and export the issue tracker

      * enable and disable the issue tracker

      * list and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components

      * enable and disable the wiki

      * list and edit default reviewers

      * list and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)

      * list and edit the repository web hooks

      * initiate a repo ownership transfer


      ### snippet


      Gives the add-on read access to all the snippets the authorizing user has access to.

      No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).


      * view any snippet

      * create snippet comments


      ### snippet:write


      Gives the add-on write access to all the snippets the authorizing user can edit.

      No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

      This implies the Snippet Read scope which does not need to be requested separately.


      * edit snippets

      * delete snippets


      ### issue


      Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.

      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.


      * view, list and search issues

      * create new issues

      * comment on issues

      * watch issues

      * vote for issues


      ### issue:write


      This implies `issue`, but adds the ability to transition and delete issues.

      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.


      * transition issues

      * delete issues


      ### wiki


      Gives access to wikis. No distinction is made between read and write as wikis are always editable by anyone.

      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the wiki is attached to.


      * view wikis

      * create pages

      * edit pages

      * push to wikis

      * clone wikis


      ### pullrequest


      Gives the add-on read access to pull requests.

      This scope implies `repository`, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository.


      * see and list pull requests

      * create and resolve tasks


      ### pullrequest:write


      Implies `pullrequest` but adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.

      This scope implies `repository:write`, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to facilitate merging.


      * merge pull requests

      * decline pull requests

      * create pull requests

      * comment on pull requests

      * approve pull requests


      ### email


      Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider to add-ons or external applications.


      ### account


      Ability to see all the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data.


      * see all email addresses

      * language

      * location

      * website

      * full name

      * SSH keys

      * user groups


      ### account:write


      Ability to change properties on the user's account.


      * delete the authorizing user's account

      * manage the user's groups

      * manupilate a user's email addresses

      * change username, display name and avatar


      ### team


      The ability to find out what teams the current user is part of. This is covered by the teams endpoint.


      * information about all the groups and teams I am a member or admin of



      ### team:write


      Implies `team`, but adds the ability to manage the teams that the authorizing user is an admin on.


      * manage team permissions


      ### webhook


      Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook

      related operation.


      This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all

      resources you can access, without needing further scopes. This means that

      a client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on repository

      `foo/bar` (assuming the principal user has access to this repo). The

      additional `repository` scope is not required for this.


      Likewise, existing webhook subscriptions for a repo's issue tracker can be

      retrieved without holding the `issue` scope. All that is required is the

      `webhook` scope.


      However, to create a webhook for `issue:created`, the client will need to

      have both the `webhook` as well as `issue` scope.


      * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team, or snippet

      * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions



      # App passwords 


      App passwords allow two-step verification users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account through apps such as Sourcetree.


      Some important points about app passwords:


      * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just create a new one.

      * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.

      * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

          App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

      * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have two-step verification enabled.

      * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app password.


      ### Create an app password


      To create an app password:


      1. Select **Avatar > Bitbucket settings**.

      2. [Click **App passwords** in the Access management section.](https://bitbucket.org/account/admin/app-passwords)

      3. Click **Create app password**.

      4. Give the app password a name related to the application that will use the password.

      5. Select the specific access and permissions you want this application password to have.

      6. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access. The password is only displayed this one time.


      That's all there is to creating an app password. See your applications documentation for how to apply the app password for a specific application.


      ## Basic auth 


      Basic HTTP Authentication as per [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported). Note that Basic Auth with username and password as credentials is only available on accounts that have 2-factor-auth / 2-step-verification disabled. If you use 2fa, you should authenticate using OAuth2 instead.

      # Filter and sort API objects


      You can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.


      Note that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. 

      See the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) 

      for details.

      ### Supported endpoints 


      Several 2.0 API resources that return collections of objects all support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.


      Currently, the endpoints which support filtering and sorting include:

          /2.0/repositories/{username}
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues
          /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests

      Filtering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR) as shown in the following examples:

      	(state = "open" OR state = "new") AND assignee = null
      	reporter.username != "evzijst" AND priority >= "major"
      	(title ~ "unicode" OR content.raw ~ "unicode") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00

      Filter queries can be added to the URL using the q= query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:

      	/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state="new"&sort=-updated_on

      ### Operators 


      Filtering and sorting supports the following operators:


      
      Operator	Definition	Example
      "="	test for equality	username = "evzijst"
      "!="	not equal	is_private != true
      "~"	case-insensitive text contains	description ~ "beef"
      "!~"	case-insensitive not contains	description !~ "fubar"
      ">"	greater than	priority > "major"
      ">="	greater than or equal	priority <= "trivial"
      "<"	less than	id < 1234
      "<="	less than or equal	updated_on <= 2015-03-04



      ### Data types 


      Filtering and sorting supports the following data types:


      
      Type	Description	Example
      String	any text inside double quotes	"foo"
      Number	arbitrary precision integers and floats	1, -10.302
      Null	to test for the absence of a value	null
      boolean	the unquoted strings true or false	true, false
      datetime	an unquoted ISO-8601 date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional	2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00, 2015-03-04T14:08:59 Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided.



      ## Querying 


      Objects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document can be used as a filter criterion.


      ### Repositories 


      You can query the following fields in the repository resource:

          uuid (string)
          full_name (string)
          scm (string)
          owner (embedded user object)
          name (string)
          description (string)
          created_on (datetime)
          updated_on (datetime)
          size (number)
          language (string)
          parent (embedded repository object)
          fork_policy (string)
          is_private (boolean)
          has_issues (boolean)
          has_wiki (boolean)

      Fields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:

      	parent.owner.username = "bitbucket"

      ### Pull Requests 


      You can query the following fields in the pull request resource:

          id (number)
          title (string)
          description (string)
          author (embedded user object)
          reviewers (embedded user object)
          state (string)
          source.repository (embedded repository object)
          source.branch.name (string)
          destination.repository (embedded repository object)
          destination.branch.name (string)
          close_source_branch (boolean)
          closed_by (embedded user object)
          reason (string)
          created_on (datetime)
          updated_on (datetime)
          task_count (number)
          comment_count (number)

      **For example**


      To find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:


      ```

      source.repository.full_name != "main/repo" AND state = "OPEN" AND reviewers.username = "evzijst" AND destination.branch.name = "master"

      ```

      ```

      /2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.username+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22

      ```


      ### Issues 


      You can query the following fields in the issues resource:

          id (number)
          title (string)
          reporter (embedded user object)
          assignee (embedded user object)
          content.raw (string)
          created_on (datetime)
          updated_on (datetime)
          state (string)
          kind (string)
          priority (string)
          version (string)
          component (string)
          milestone (string)
          watches (number)
          votes (number)

      **For example**


      To find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:


      ```

      (state = "new" OR state = "on hold") AND assignee = null AND component = "UI" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00

      ```

      ```

      /2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00

      ```


      ### Refs (Branches/Tags/Bookmarks) 


      You can query the following fields in the refs resource:

          name (string)
          type (string)

      **For example**


      To find all tags with the string "2015" in the name:


      ```

      name ~ "2015"

      ```

      ```

      /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22

      ```

      Or all my branches and bookmarks:


      ```

      name ~ "erik/"

      ```

      ```

      /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22

      ```

      ## Sorting query results 


      You can sort result sets using the ?sort= query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:


      * In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.

      * By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).

      * Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.

      # Pagination


      Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply pagination.

      Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper object:


      ```json

      {
        "size": 5421,
        "page": 2,
        "pagelen: 10,
        "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
        "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
        "values": [
          ...
        ]
      }

      ```


      Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating which

      page is to be returned.


      However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by manipulating

      the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link to the

      next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not to be

      constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only contract

      around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.


      Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.


      The paginated response contains the following fields:


      
      Field	Value
      size	Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute.
      page	Page number of the current results. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses.
      pagelen	Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally, the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a different default.
      next	Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.
      previous	Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.
      values	The list of objects. This contains at most pagelen objects.



      The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous and size values can be expensive for some data sets.


      It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered, finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud, list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.


      However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite – much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else. In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses iterator-based pagination.

      # Partial responses


      By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource and in

      some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of pull

      requests can amount to quite a large document.


      For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields you

      really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and to

      add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query

      parameter.



      ## Example


      Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related

      resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is

      somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.


      To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:


      ```json

      $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links

      {
        "username": "evzijst",
        "nickname": "evzijst",
        "account_status": "active",
        "website": "",
        "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
        "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
        "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
        "location": null,
        "type": "user"
      }

      ```


      ## Fields parameter syntax


      The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:


      1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)

      2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint, while
         still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
      3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g. `owner.username`)


      The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated field names

      (e.g. `fields=owner.username,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter itself is

      not repeated.


      As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full Objects](serialization#representations),

      most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is an

      embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that omits

      many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional fields in

      such cases.


      For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not normally

      contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:

      `+values.destination.repository.owner`.



      ## Wildcards


      The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For

      example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like this:


      ```json

      $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*

      {
        "username": "evzijst",
        "nickname": "evzijst",
        "account_status": "active",
        "website": "",
        "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
        "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
        "links": {},
        "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
        "location": null,
        "type": "user"
      }

      ```


      Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For

      instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level and then

      add in `foo` and `bar`.



      ## URL encoding


      Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that the

      "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:


      ```

      https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on

      ```


      Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will not

      match any fields.



      ## Field discovery


      While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically return

      the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for fields that

      are overly verbose or costly to generate.


      For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers and

      participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not from the

      `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too much.


      To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,

      `fields=*` can be used.



      ## More examples


      If we want to get a list of all reviewer usernames on pull requests I created,

      we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This will omit

      all other data from the response:


      ```

      /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.username,values.state&q=author.username%3D%22erik%22

      {
        "values": [
          {
            "reviewers": [
              {

              },
              {
                "username": "dtao"
              },
              {
                "username": "csomme"
              }
            ],
            "state": "OPEN",
            "id": 11355
          },
          {

              {
                "username": "dstevens"

            ],
            "state": "MERGED",
            "id": 11347
          },
          {
            "reviewers": [
              {
                "username": "csomme"
              },
              {
                "username": "jmooring"
              },
              {
                "username": "zdavis"
              },
              {
                "username": "flexbox"
              }
            ],
            "state": "OPEN",
            "id": 11344
          }
        ]
      }

      ## Open API Specification 


      Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,

      formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification schema

      is hosted at [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)

      and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of all

      available endpoints.


      The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:

      auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing with

      authentication and error handling.


      You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification at:

      [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).



      ## JSON Schema 


      Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of object

      consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the

      `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.


      When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also expects

      the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to objects

      returned by an endpoint.



      ## Condensed Versus Full Objects 


      Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial" representation.

      The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the layout

      returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g. `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),

      as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).


      However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a `repository`

      object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest` object

      embeds its `repository` object.


      These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter" when

      clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on common,

      related information.


      Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid such

      object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their own

      nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and

      utility.


      An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be standardized,

      meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the object

      was embedded.

      # URI, UUID, and structures


      You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of Bitbucket's REST implementation.


      ----

      **On this page**


      * [URI structure](#uri-structure)

      * [HTTP methods](#http-methods)

      * [UUID](#uuid)
          * [User object and UUID](#userobj)
          * [Repository object and UUID](#repo-obj)
          * [Team object and UUID](#teamobj)
      * [Standard error repsponses](#stand-error)

      * [Standard ISO-8601 timestamps](#timestamp)


      ----



      ## URI structure 


      All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).


      The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request. For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org

      ```

      Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository is an example:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues

      ```

      ### HTTP methods 

      A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP methods:


      
      Call	Description
      GET	Retrieves information.
      PUT	Updates existing information.
      POST	Creates new information.
      DELETE	Removes existing information.



      For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and create an issue on the issue tracker.


      **Specifying content length**


      You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:


      ```

      curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:pass https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com

      ```

      ## Universally Unique Identifier 


      UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but not if you are pointing to the UUID.


      ### UUID examples and structure


      UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and repository objects. The following examples the following characters are replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.


      ### User object and UUID 


      When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user the response is the same.


      **Call with username**:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials

      ```


      ***Call with UUID for the user**:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D

      ```


      **Response**

          "display_name": "tutorials account",

          "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
          "type": "user"
      }

      ```


      ### Repository object and UUID 


      Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name changes.


      **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie

      ```

      **Call with UUID and empty field**:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

      ```


      **Call with UUID and teamname**:


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

      ```

      This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either case.


      **Call with teamname**


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members

      ```

      **Call with UUID for team object**


      ```

      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

      ```

      ## Standardized error responses 


      The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a JSON

      object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object provides a

      detailed  problem description.


      ```json

      {
          "type": "error",
          "error": {
              "message": "Bad request",
              "fields": {
                  "src": [
                      "This field is required."
                  ]
              },
              "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
              "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
              "data": {
                "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
              }
          }
      }

      ```


      This object contains an error element which contains the following nested

      elements:


      
      Element	Description
      message	A short description of the problem. This element is always present. Its value may be localized.
      fields	This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The values may be localized.
      detail	An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value may be localized.
      id	An optional unique error identifier that identifies the error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem.



      ## Standard ISO-8601 timestamps 


      All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original timezone.

      # Cors and hypermedia


      This section describes [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS), what content types we support in requests and responses, and hyperlinking resources in each json responses.

      ## Cors 


      The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information you can refer to:


      * [Wikipedia article on CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

      * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)


      Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:


      `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`


      Gives this result:

      ## Supported content types 


      The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by the client.


      Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your client can omit immutable fields from a request body.


      In some cases, a resource might also accept regular application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects always require JSON.


      ## Resource links 


      Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting" function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a specific user:



      `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`


      ```json

      {
          "username": "tutorials",
          "nickname": "tutorials",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
          "display_name": "tutorials account",
          "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
          "links": {
              "self": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
              },
              "repositories": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
              },
              "html": {
                  "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
              },
              "followers": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
              },
              "avatar": {
                  "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
              },
              "following": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
              }
          },
          "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
          "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
          "type": "user"
      }

      ```

      Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API responses.


      A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following link:


      ```json

      "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
      }

      ```


      The rel for this link is self and the href is https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.


      Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below, the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects. Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.


      ```json

      "links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
        },
        "clone": [
          {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
            "name": "https"
          },
          {
            "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
            "name": "ssh"
          }
        ],
        ...
      }

      ```

      Links can support [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570); Those that do contain a `"templated": "true"` element.

      You can use the Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud to build add-ons which

      can connect with the Bitbucket UI and your own application set. An add-on could

      be an integration with another existing service, new features for the Atlassian

      application, or even a new product that runs within the Atlassian application.

      The issue resources provide functionality for getting information on

      issues in an issue tracker, creating new issues, updating them and deleting

      them.


      You can access public issues without authentication, but you can't gain access

      to private repositories' issues. By authenticating, you will get the ability

      to create issues, as well as access to updating data or deleting issues you

      have access to.

      Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make requests to

      your server (or another external service) whenever certain events occur in

      Bitbucket Cloud.


      A webhook consists of:


      * A subject -- The resource that generates the events. Currently, this resource
        is the repository, user account, or team where you create the webhook.
      * One or more event -- The default event is a repository push, but you can
        select multiple events that can trigger the webhook.
      * A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the event payloads
        when a matching event happens.

      There are two parts to getting a webhook to work: creating the webhook and

      triggering the webhook. After you create a webhook for an event, every time

      that event occurs, Bitbucket sends a payload request that describes the event

      to the specified URL. Thus, you can think of webhooks as a kind of

      notification system.


      Use webhooks to integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The following

      use cases provides examples of when you would want to use webhooks:


      * Every time a user pushes commits in a repository, you may want to notify
        your CI server to start a build.
      * Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request, you may want to
        display a notification in your application.

      Commit statuses provide a way to tag commits with meta data,
      like automated build results.
  - name: branchrestrictions
    description: |
      Repository owners and administrators can set branch management
      rules on a repository that control what can be pushed by whom.
      Through these rules, you can enforce a project or team
      workflow. For example, owners or administrators can:

      * Limit push powers
      * Prevent branch (bookmark) deletion
      * Prevent history re-writes (Git only)

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories require the

        caller to authenticate with an account that has appropriate

        authorization.


        For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.

        refs/heads).


        For Mercurial, the response will include an additional field that lists

        the open heads.

        For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.
        refs/heads). For Mercurial, this closes all open heads on the branch,
        sets the author of the commit to the authenticated caller, and changes
        the date to the datetime of the call.

        Returns an object for each repository the caller has explicit access
        to and their effective permission — the highest level of permission the
        caller has. This does not return public repositories that the user was
        not granted any specific permission in, and does not distinguish between
        direct and indirect privileges.

        Permissions can be:

        * `admin`
        * `write`
        * `read`

        Example:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/user/permissions/repositories

        {
          "pagelen": 10,
          "values": [
            {
              "type": "repository_permission",
              "user": {
                "type": "user",
                "username": "evzijst",
                "nickname": "evzijst",
                "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
                "uuid": "{d301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567}"
              },
              "repository": {
                "type": "repository",
                "name": "geordi",
                "full_name": "bitbucket/geordi",
                "uuid": "{85d08b4e-571d-44e9-a507-fa476535aa98}"
              },
              "permission": "admin"
            }
          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 1
        }
        ```

        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../../../meta/filtering) by
        repository or permission by adding the following query string
        parameters:

        * `q=repository.name="geordi"` or `q=permission>"read"`
        * `sort=repository.name`

        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`
        would become `%3D`.

        $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'           https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/hooks           -d '

        Note that this call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope

        These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned

        in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log` and

        `hg log`. Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/


        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit

        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to

        `git log --all` and `hg log`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/master


        Returns all commits on rev `master` (similar to `git log master`,

        `hg log master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?exclude=master


        Returns all commits on ref `dev`, except those that are reachable on

        `master` (similar to `git log dev ^master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master


        Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master

        (similar to `git log --all ^master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or

        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).


        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the

        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file

        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that

        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is

        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits

        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that

        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`

        that changed the file README.md.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`

        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.


        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it

        is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the

        next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not

        construct your own links.


        When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a

        query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

        The above example also includes a custom comment to go alongside the
        change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in the UI.

        The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects. This
        allows for immutable change log records, even after user accounts,
        milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get renamed or
        deleted.

        The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When POSTing a
        new change and changing the assignee, the client should therefore use
        the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new` field.

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories or private
        issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account that
        has appropriate authorization.

        Each time an issue is edited in the UI or through the API, an immutable

        change record is created under the `/issues/123/changes` endpoint. It

        also has a comment associated with the change.


        Note that this operation is changing significantly, due to privacy changes.

        Changes support [filtering and sorting](../../../meta/filtering) that

        can be used to search for specific changes. For instance, to see

        when an issue transitioned to "resolved":


        ```

        $ curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/site/master/issues/1/changes \
           -G --data-urlencode='q=changes.state.new = "resolved"'
        ```


        This resource is only available on repositories that have the issue

        tracker enabled.


        N.B.


        The `changes.assignee` and `changes.assignee_account_id` fields are not

        a `user` object. Instead, they contain the raw `username` and

        `account_id` of the user. This is to protect the integrity of the audit

        log even after a user account gets deleted.


        The `changes.assignee` field is deprecated will disappear in the

        future. Use `changes.assignee_account_id` instead.

        Creates a new branch in the specified repository.


        The payload of the POST should consist of a JSON document that

        contains the name of the tag and the target hash.


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/seanfarley/hg/refs/branches \

        -s -u seanfarley -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

        -d '{
            "name" : "smf/create-feature",
            "target" : {
                "hash" : "default",
            }
        }'

        ```


        This call requires authentication. Private repositories require the

        caller to authenticate with an account that has appropriate

        authorization.


        For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.

        refs/heads). This endpoint does support using short hash prefixes for

        the commit hash, but it may return a 400 response if the provided

        prefix is ambiguous. Using a full commit hash is the preferred

        approach.


        For Mercurial, the authenticated user making this call is the author of

        the new branch commit and the date is current datetime of the call.

        Branches support [filtering and sorting](../../../../../meta/filtering)

        that can be used to search for specific branches. For instance, to find

        all branches that have "stab" in their name:


        ```

        curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/seanfarley/mercurial/refs/branches -G --data-urlencode 'q=name ~ "stab"'

        ```


        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to

        the ordering one sees when running "$ hg branches" or "$ git branch --list". Note that this follows simple

        lexical ordering of the ref names.


        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are

        sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].


        Sorting can be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly sort on ref name,

        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

        Update the branching model configuration for a repository.

        The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to
        track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must
        currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is
        not possible to update the settings for `development` if that
        would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be
        rejected.

        The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main
        branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently
        exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or
        disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A
        request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be
        rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if
        it would also be left disabled.

        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.
        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be
        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.
        For branch types this means that:

        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be
        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must
        have a `kind` property to identify it.

        Return the branching model configuration for a repository. The returned
        object:

        1. Always has a `development` property for the development branch.
        2. Always a `production` property for the production branch. The
           production branch can be disabled.
        3. The `branch_types` contains all the branch types.

        This is the raw configuration for the branching model. A client
        wishing to see the branching model with its actual current branches may
        find the [active model API](../branching-model#get) more useful.

        Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline. 

        There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.

        # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch

        One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline. 

        The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "ref_type": "branch", 
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target", 
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag

        You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).

        The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference. 


        The following reference types are supported:


        * `branch` 

        * `named_branch`

        * `bookmark` 
         * `tag`

        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit", 
                "hash": "ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956"
              }, 
              "ref_type": "branch", 
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target", 
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit

        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit. 

        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
                "selector": {
                   "type":"custom",
                      "pattern":"Deploy to production"
                  },
                "type":"pipeline_commit_target"
           }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag

        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference. 

        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
               "selector": {
                  "type": "custom",
                  "pattern": "Deploy to production"
               },
               "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
               "ref_name": "master",
               "ref_type": "branch"
             }
          }'
        ```



        # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables

        In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured).


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \
         -d '

              "ref_type": "branch",
              "ref_name": "master",
              "selector": {
                "type": "custom",
                "pattern": "Deploy to production"
              }
            },
            "variables": [
              {
                "key": "var1key",
                "value": "var1value",
                "secured": true
              },
              {
                "key": "var2key",
                "value": "var2value"
              }
            ]
          }'

        Returns an object for each team permission a user on the team has.


        Permissions returned are effective permissions — if a user is a member of

        multiple groups with distinct roles, only the highest level is returned.


        Permissions can be:


        * `admin`

        * `collaborator`


        Only users with admin permission for the team may access this resource.


        Example:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/atlassian_tutorial/permissions


        {
          "pagelen": 10,

          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 2
        }

        ```


        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../../../meta/filtering) by

        team, user, or permission by adding the following query string

        parameters:


        * `q=user.username="evzijst"` or `q=permission="admin"`

        * `sort=team.display_name`


        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`

        would become `%3D`.

        Produces a raw, git-style diff for either a single commit (diffed
        against its first parent), or a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a 3-way diff, or merge diff,
        is computed. This shows the changes introduced by the left branch
        (`3a8b42` in our example) as compared againt the right branch
        (`9ff173`).

        This is equivalent to merging the left branch into the right branch and
        then computing the diff of the merge commit against its first parent
        (the right branch). This follows the same behavior as pull requests
        that also show this style of 3-way, or merge diff.

        While similar to patches, diffs:

        * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
          the diff to just that one file diff

        The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

        description: The new rule
        required: true
      description: |-
        Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.

        `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include:
        `push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`.

        Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:

        * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
          specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
          denied for everybody.
        * `force` can not be specified in a Mercurial repository.

        The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are
        two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:

        1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
           `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
           other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
           `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
           branches.
        2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's
           branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
           to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
           `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.

        The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that
        two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and
        `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a
        repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.

        `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from
        the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and
        `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user
        pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a
        member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user
        merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in
        `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or
        groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.

        Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,
        but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        ### Update

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the
        project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to

        change a snippet's title.


        To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the

        parts that need to be changed.


        The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the

        request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently

        manipulated with differential payloads.


        To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in

        the request, but omit its value (use `null`).


        As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to

        rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can

        be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to

        the SCM.


        PUT supports three different content types for both request and

        response bodies:


        * `application/json`

        * `multipart/related`

        * `multipart/form-data`


        The content type used for the request body can be different than that

        used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP

        headers.


        Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired

        request and response format.



        application/json

        ----------------


        As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what

        properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support

        file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.


        To update the title, without changing any of its files:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'


        To delete the title:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'

        Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator

        for instance are immutable.



        multipart/related

        -----------------


        `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's

        properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from

        the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,

        the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical

        to `application/json` requests.


        To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its

        title:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 288
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
              "title": "My updated snippet",
              "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {}
                }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
            Content-ID: "foo.txt"
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="foo.txt"

            Updated file contents.

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The

        other files remain untouched.


        Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains

        the files that are being manipulated. This list should have

        corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents

        of these files.


        If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,

        it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 188
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
              "files": {
                "image.png": {}
              }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under

        another name:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 212
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
                "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {},
                  "bar.txt": {}
                }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
            Content-ID: "bar.txt"
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bar.txt"

            foo

            --===============1438169132528273974==--


        multipart/form-data

        -----------------


        Again, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file

        contents and meta data atomically.

            $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title="My updated snippet" -F file=@foo.txt

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 351
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My updated snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f

        To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the

        `files` field:

            $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 149
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------ef8871065a86

            ------------------------------ef8871065a86
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"

            image.png
            ------------------------------ef8871065a86--

        The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and

        `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.

        The default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,

        regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a

        convenience to the client.
    get:
      description: >-
        Retrieves a single snippet.


        Snippets support multiple content types:


        * application/json

        * multipart/related

        * multipart/form-data



        application/json

        ----------------


        The default content type of the response is `application/json`.

        Since JSON is always `utf-8`, it cannot reliably contain file contents

        for files that are not text. Therefore, JSON snippet documents only

        contain the filename and links to the file contents.


        This means that in order to retrieve all parts of a snippet, N+1

        requests need to be made (where N is the number of files in the

        snippet).



        multipart/related

        -----------------


        To retrieve an entire snippet in a single response, use the

        `Accept: multipart/related` HTTP request header.

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/related" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/1

        Response:

        multipart/form-data

        -------------------


        As with creating new snippets, `multipart/form-data` can be used as an

        alternative to `multipart/related`. However, the inherently flat

        structure of form-data means that only basic, root-level properties

        can be returned, while nested elements like `links` are omitted:

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/form-data" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj

        Returns an object for each repository permission for all of a

        team’s repositories.


        If the username URL parameter refers to a user account instead of

        a team account, an object containing the repository permissions

        of all the username's repositories will be returned.


        Permissions returned are effective permissions — the highest level of

        permission the user has. This does not include public repositories that

        users are not granted any specific permission in, and does not

        distinguish between direct and indirect privileges.


        Only users with admin permission for the team may access this resource.


        Permissions can be:


        * `admin`

        * `write`

        * `read`


        Example:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/atlassian_tutorial/permissions/repositories


        {
          "pagelen": 10,

              },
              "repository": {

          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 2
        }

        ```


        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../../../../meta/filtering)

        by repository, user, or permission by adding the following query string

        parameters:


        * `q=repository.name="geordi"` or `q=permission>"read"`

        * `sort=user.display_name`


        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`

        would become `%3D`.

        Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the specified file.


        Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is roughly

        equivalent to the following commands:

            $ git log --follow --date-order  

            $ hg log --follow 

        By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in the

        returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using the

        `?renames=false` query parameter.


        Results are returned in descending chronological order by default, and

        like most endpoints you can

        [filter and sort](../../../../../../meta/filtering) the response to

        only provide exactly the data you want.


        For example, if you wanted to find commits made before 2011-05-18

        against a file named `README.rst`, but you only wanted the path and

        date, your query would look like this:


        ```

        $ curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
          '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
        {
          "values": [
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-17T07:32:09+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.rst"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:33:28+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:15:39+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        In the response you can see that the file was renamed to `README.rst`

        by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named `README.txt`.

        This example changes the `title`, `assignee`, `priority` and the

        `version`. It also removes the value of the `component` from the issue

        by setting the field to `null`. Any field not present keeps its existing

        value.


        Each time an issue is edited in the UI or through the API, an immutable

        change record is created under the `/issues/123/changes` endpoint. It

        also has a comment associated with the change.

            Field by which the results should be sorted as per

            [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering). The `name`

            field is handled specially for refs in that, if specified as the sort field, it

            uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,

            it will return ['1.1', '1.2', '1.10'] instead of ['1.1', '1.10', '1.2'].

        Returns the branches and tags in the repository.


        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to

        the ordering one sees when running "$ git show-ref". Note that this follows simple

        lexical ordering of the ref names.


        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that refs are

        sorted ["branch1", "branch10", "branch2", "v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["branch1", "branch2",

        "branch10", "v9", "v10", "v11"].


        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,

        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

        This endpoint is used to poll for the progress of an issue export

        job and return the zip file after the job is complete.

        As long as the job is running, this will return a 200 response

        with in the response body a description of the current status.


        After the job has been scheduled, but before it starts executing, this

        endpoint's response is:


        {
         "type": "issue_job_status",
         "status": "ACCEPTED",
         "phase": "Initializing",
         "total": 0,
         "count": 0,
         "pct": 0
        }



        Then once it starts running, it becomes:


        {
         "type": "issue_job_status",
         "status": "STARTED",
         "phase": "Attachments",
         "total": 15,
         "count": 11,
         "pct": 73
        }


        Once the job has successfully completed, it returns a stream of the zip file.

        of the username's repository will be returned.


        Permissions returned are effective permissions — the highest level of

        permission the user has. This does not include public repositories that

        users are not granted any specific permission in, and does not

        distinguish between direct and indirect privileges.


        Only users with admin permission for the repository may access this resource.


        Permissions can be:


        * `admin`

        * `write`

        * `read`

        ```

        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../../../../meta/filtering)

        by user, or permission by adding the following query string parameters:


        * `q=permission>"read"`

        * `sort=user.display_name`


        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`

        would become `%3D`.

        Produces a raw patch for a single commit (diffed against its first
        parent), or a patch-series for a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a patch series is returned
        for the commits on the source branch (`3a8b42` and its ancestors in
        our example). For Mercurial, a single patch is returned that combines
        the changes of all commits on the source branch.

        While similar to diffs, patches:

        * Have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Do not support the `path=foo/bar.py` query parameter

        The raw patch is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

            "full_name": "evzijst/dogslow",
            ...
          },
          ...
        }

        ```


        If you already have a repo with that name, then a 400 is returned and

        you'll need to specify a custom name for the new fork:


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "dogslow_fork"
        }'

        ```


        When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the `slug`.

        The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork. It is

        derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes

        whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,

        `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.


        ## Forking a repository into a team account


        To create a fork into a team account, specify the new owner's account

        explicitly as part of the request body. This prevents forked

        repositories from being owned by the authenticated user submitting the

        request:


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "bbql_fork",
            "owner": {
              "username": "atlassian"
            }
        }'

        ```


        To fork a repository into the same team, also specify a new `name`.


        You need contributor access to create new forks within a team account.



        ## Change the properties of a new fork


        By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.

        However, since the optional POST body document follows the normal

        `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's

        properties.


        Properties that can be overridden include:


        * description

        * fork_policy

        * language

        * mainbranch

        * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit
          the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
        * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
          tracker are not copied during forking)
        * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
          copied during forking)
        * project (only teams have projects and when forking into a private
          project, the fork's `is_private` must be `true`)

        Properties that cannot be modified include:


        * scm

        * parent

        * full_name

        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../../../meta/filtering) by
        team or permission by adding the following query string parameters:

        * `q=team.username="bitbucket"` or `q=permission="admin"`
        * `sort=team.display_name`

        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`
        would become `%3D`.

        read-only. The branching model settings can be changed using the
        [settings](branching-model/settings#get) API.

        The returned object:

        1. Always has a `development` property. `development.branch` contains
           the actual repository branch object that is considered to be the
           `development` branch. `development.branch` will not be present
           if it does not exist.
        2. Might have a `production` property. `production` will not
           be present when `production` is disabled.
           `production.branch` contains the actual branch object that is
           considered to be the `production` branch. `production.branch` will
           not be present if it does not exist.
        3. Always has a `branch_types` array which contains all enabled branch
           types.

        This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,

        or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.


        ## Raw file contents


        When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.

        The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename

        extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed

        and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no

        character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.


        The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to prevent

        browsers from running executable files.


        If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to

        Atlassian's media services platform is returned.


        The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file

        and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always

        returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the

        commit it is on.


        ## File meta data


        When the request for a file path includes the query parameter

        `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket

        instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:


        ```javascript

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta

        {
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "path": "tests/__init__.py",
          "commit": {
            "type": "commit",
            "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
            "links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              },
              "html": {
                "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              }
            }
          },
          "attributes": [],
          "type": "commit_file",
          "size": 0
        }

        ```


        File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of

        possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:


        * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents
            of the file represent the path the link points to.
        * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.

        * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or
            subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
            pointed to.
        * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.


        This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be

        used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without

        incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.



        ## Directory listings


        When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a

        paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the

        underlying SCM system would return them.


        For example:


        ```javascript

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests

        {
          "pagelen": 10,
          "values": [

                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"

        When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a

        trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.


        The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of

        a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into

        subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree, the

        client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each

        `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.


        The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories

        up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of

        file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too

        large, the call will time out and return a 555.


        Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,

        both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path

        from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`

        object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely

        the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last

        modified the file.


        Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the

        paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand

        returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:


        ```javascript

        {
          "path": "tests/test_project",
          "type": "commit_directory",
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "commit": { ... }
        }

        ```


        ## Querying, filtering and sorting


        Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket

        querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing

        to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to

        list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:


        `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`


        which after urlencoding yields the query string:


        `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`


        To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:


        `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`


        See [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering) for more

        details.

        Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.


        Snippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are

        supported.


        The simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:

            $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png

        Creating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so let's look

        at a more complicated scenario.


        Snippets are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`

        and `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation of

        snippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text

        and binary files.


        The main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding

        for the meta data (currently JSON).



        multipart/related (RFC-2387)

        ----------------------------


        This is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.


        The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's

        properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the

        request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to

        point to it.


        The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.

        Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through

        which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value

        should be the name of the file.


        `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's

        optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name

        that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,

        `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.


        When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are

        not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its

        name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is

        mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).



        multipart/form-data

        -------------------


        The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can

        also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional

        `multipart/form-data` request:

            $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png

            POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 951
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
            Content-Type: application/octet-stream

            ?PNG

            IHDR?1??I.....
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--

        Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form

        fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach

        multiple files, simply repeat the field.


        The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is

        that it can be easier to build clients.


        Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.



        Sharing and Visibility

        ----------------------


        Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well

        as anonymous users), or private (visible only to the owner, creator

        and members of the team in case the snippet is owned by a team). This

        is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:


        * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view
          the snippet
        * **is_private=true** -- only the owner and team members (for team
          snippets) can view it

        To create the snippet under a team account, just append the team name

        to the URL (see `/2.0/snippets/{username}`).

        Returns all snippets. Like pull requests, repositories and teams, the

        full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has access to.


        This includes all snippets owned by the current user, but also all snippets

        owned by any of the teams the user is a member of, or snippets by other

        users that the current user is either watching or has collaborated on (for

        instance by commenting on it).


        To limit the set of returned snippets, apply the

        `?role=[owner|contributor|member]` query parameter where the roles are

        defined as follows:


        * `owner`: all snippets owned by the current user

        * `contributor`: all snippets owned by, or watched by the current user

        * `member`: owned by the user, their teams, or watched by the current user


        When no role is specified, all public snippets are returned, as well as all

        privately owned snippets watched or commented on.


        The returned response is a normal paginated JSON list. This endpoint

        only supports `application/json` responses and no

        `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/related`. As a result, it is not

        possible to include the file contents.

          The new pull request.


          The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL. For this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the request object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).


          Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch and the title.
      description: >-
        Creates a new pull request where the destination repository is

        this repository and the author is the authenticated user.


        The minimum required fields to create a pull request are `title` and

        `source`, specified by a branch name.


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-username/my-repository/pullrequests \
            -u my-username:my-password \
            --request POST \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
                "title": "My Title",
                "source": {
                    "branch": {
                        "name": "staging"
                    }
                }
            }'
        ```


        If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will default

        to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a

        different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging branch,

        specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):


        ```

        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },
            "destination": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "staging"
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects as the

        `reviewers` property.


        ```

        These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned

        in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log` and

        `hg log`. Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/


        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit

        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to

        `git log --all` and `hg log`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/master


        Returns all commits on rev `master` (similar to `git log master`,

        `hg log master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?exclude=master


        Returns all commits on ref `dev`, except those that are reachable on

        `master` (similar to `git log dev ^master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master


        Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master

        (similar to `git log --all ^master`).


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or

        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).


        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the

        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file

        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that

        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is

        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits

        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that

        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`

        that changed the file README.md.


        ## GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`

        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.


        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it

        is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the

        next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not

        construct your own links.


        When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a

        query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

        Returns a paginated list of all repositories owned by the specified
        account or UUID.

        The result can be narrowed down based on the authenticated user's role.

        E.g. with `?role=contributor`, only those repositories that the
        authenticated user has write access to are returned (this includes any
        repo the user is an admin on, as that implies write access).

        This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See
        [filtering and sorting](../../meta/filtering) for more details.

            Field by which the results should be sorted as per

            [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering). The `name`

            field is handled specially for tags in that, if specified as the sort field, it

            uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,

            it will return ['1.1', '1.2', '1.10'] instead of ['1.1', '1.10', '1.2'].

        Returns the tags in the repository.


        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to

        the ordering one sees when running "$ hg tags" or "$ git tag --list". Note that this follows simple

        lexical ordering of the ref names.


        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are

        sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].


        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,

        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

        POST a new custom event.


        The data within the event body will be hydrated by Bitbucket. For example, the following event

        submission would result in subscribers for the event receiving the full repository object

        corresponding to the UUID.


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "mynumdata": "12345",
            "repository": {
                "type": "repository",
                "uuid": "{be95aa1f-c0b2-47f6-99d1-bf5d3a0f850f}"
        }}' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon/users/myuser/events/com.example.app%3Amyevent

        ```


        Use the optional `fields` property of the custom event Connect

        module where the event is defined to add additional

        fields to the expanded payload sent to listeners.


        For example, the `customEvents` module in the app descriptor for the previous example would look like this:


        ```

        'modules': {
            'customEvents': {
                'com.example.app:myevent': {
                    'schema': {
                        'properties': {
                            'mynumdata': {'type': 'number'},
                            'repository': {'$ref': '#/definitions/repository'}
                        }
                    },
                    'fields': ['repository.owner']
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        By specifying fields as above, the repository owner

        will also be sent to subscribers of the event.

            Optional field that declares the files that the request is
            manipulating. When adding a new file to a repo, or when
            overwriting an existing file, the client can just upload
            the full contents of the file in a normal form field and
            the use of this `files` meta data field is redundant.
            However, when the `files` field contains a file path that
            does not have a corresponding, identically-named form
            field, then Bitbucket interprets that as the client wanting
            to replace the named file with the null set and the file is
            deleted instead.

            Paths in the repo that are referenced in neither files nor
            an individual file field, remain unchanged and carry over
            from the parent to the new commit.

            This API does not support renaming as an explicit feature.
            To rename a file, simply delete it and recreate it under
            the new name in the same commit.

            created on. When omitted, the commit will be created on top
            of the main branch and will become the main branch's new
            HEAD/tip.

            When a branch name is provided that already exists in the
            repo, then the commit will be created on top of that
            branch. In this case, if a parent SHA1 was also provided,
            then it is asserted that the parent is the branch's
            tip/HEAD at the time the request is made. When this is not
            the case, a 409 is returned.

            This API cannot be used to create new anonymous heads in
            Mercurial repos.

            When a new branch name is specified (that does not already
            exist in the repo), and no parent SHA1s are provided, then
            the new commit will inherit from the current main branch's
            tip/HEAD commit, but not advance the main branch. The new
            commit will be the new branch. When the request also
            specifies a parent SHA1, then the new commit and branch
            are created directly on top of the parent commit,
            regardless of the state of the main branch.

            When a branch name is not specified, but a parent SHA1 is
            provided, then Bitbucket asserts that it represents the
            main branch's current HEAD/tip, or a 409 is returned.

            When a branch name is not specified and the repo is empty,
            the new commit will become the repo's root commit and will
            be on the main branch.

            When a branch name is specified and the repo is empty, the
            new commit will become the repo's root commit and also

            This API cannot be used to create additional root commits
            in non-empty repos.

            The branch field cannot be repeated.

            As a side effect, this API can be used to create a new
            branch without modifying any files, by specifying a new
            branch name in this field, together with parents, but
            omitting the files fields, while not sending any files.
            This will create a new commit and branch with the same
            contents as the first parent. The diff of this commit
            against its first parent will be empty.

        This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by

        uploading files.


        To add a new file to a repository:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
        ```


        This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the

        contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the

        `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.


        To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
        ```


        You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a

        file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.


        This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),

        as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.


        ## multipart/form-data


        A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form fields" that

        identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as

        additional, optional meta data.


        Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a

        `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote

        path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field

        names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the

        repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the

        above `curl` example did).


        File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.


        The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the

        request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields

        share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`

        bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the

        `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to

        distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit message field.


        ## application/x-www-form-urlencoded


        It is also possible to upload new files using a simple

        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when

        uploading pure text files:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \
          --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
          --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
          --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst "
        ```


        There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file

        named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data property

        for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names

        clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,

        e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.


        When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of

        a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a

        file.


        ## Executables and links


        While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is

        possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new

        symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.


        Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the

        `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable

        file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:


        ```

        --===============1438169132528273974==

        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        MIME-Version: 1.0

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

        Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh"; x-attributes:"executable"


        #!/bin/sh

        halt


        --===============1438169132528273974==

        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        MIME-Version: 1.0

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

        Content-ID: "/README.txt"

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt"; x-attributes:"link"


        README

        --===============1438169132528273974==--

        ```


        Links are files that contain the target path and have

        `x-attributes:"link"` set.


        When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded

        file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That

        means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes="link"` will

        create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at

        the same path.


        The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable

        file, the form-data file element must include

        `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the executable status

        of the file.


        Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of

        subrepos / submodules.

        Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `patch`
        resource.

        The differences between a diff and a patch are:

        * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc
        * diffs support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the
          diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
        * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
          its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
          response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
          parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
          its reachability).

        Note that the character encoding of the contents of the diff is
        unspecified as Git and Mercurial do not track this, making it hard for
        Bitbucket to reliably determine this.

        If the specified key already exists, the existing status object will

        be overwritten.


        When creating a new commit status, you can use a URI template for the URL.

        Templates are URLs that contain variable names that Bitbucket will

        evaluate at runtime whenever the URL is displayed anywhere similar to

        parameter substitution in

        [Bitbucket Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/concepts/context-parameters.html).

        For example, one could use `https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name}`

        which Bitbucket will turn into `https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar` at render time.

        The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        repository, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an example
        of the request body.

        ### Update

        Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the location to
        be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived from the
        name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it is
        possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug conflicts
        with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no conflict,
        the new location will be returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        Creates a new repository.

        Note: In order to set the project for the newly created repository,
        pass in either the project key or the project UUID as part of the
        request body as shown in the examples below:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "MARS"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        or

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "{ba516952-992a-4c2d-acbd-17d502922f96}"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        The project must only be assigned for repositories belonging to a team.
        If the repository owner is a team and the project is not provided, the
        repository is automatically assigned to the oldest project in the team.

        Note: In the examples above, the username `teamsinspace`,
        and/or the repository name `hablanding` can be replaced by UUIDs.

        Identical to `UPDATE /snippets/encoded_id`, except that this endpoint
        takes an explicit commit revision. Only the snippet's "HEAD"/"tip"
        (most recent) version can be updated and requests on all other,
        older revisions fail by returning a 405 status.

        Usage of this endpoint over the unrestricted `/snippets/encoded_id`
        could be desired if the caller wants to be sure no concurrent
        modifications have taken place between the moment of the UPDATE
        request and the original GET.

        This can be considered a so-called "Compare And Swap", or CAS
        operation.

        Other than that, the two endpoints are identical in behavior.

        Returns the patch of the specified commit against its first
        parent.

        Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `diff`
        resource.

        The differences between a diff and a patch are:

        * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc
        * diffs support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the
          diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
        * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
          its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
          response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
          parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
          its reachability).

        Note that the character encoding of the contents of the patch is
        unspecified as Git and Mercurial do not track this, making it hard for
        Bitbucket to reliably determine this.
